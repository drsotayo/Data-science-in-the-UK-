## Motivation 
I work as a Data Professional Development Expert, Data Analytics Lecturer and Trainer based in the UK. I've worked in tech organisations (e.g. Deliveroo) and several academic institutions (e.g. University of Liverpool, Lancaster University, Brunel University London and University College Dublin) across the UK and Ireland.

My interest in this analysis is due to my  passion for data analytics as well as my experience in delivering training programmes to help people develop their careers in the UK. Therefore, this analysis focuses on a unique and specific subset of the [2022 Kaggle Machine Learning & Data Science Survey responses](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/kaggle-survey-2022), i.e. UK Kagglers represented in this survey. In the context of this analysis, the UK represents the **United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland**. 

This analysis aims to answer some questions related to **Data Science Professionals in the UK**, which are shown below:

    1. How much do they earn and what factors contribute to a higher salary?
    2. Does experience really matter and by how much?
    3. Do the programming languages correlate with the job titles?
    4. How does the UK compare with Europe in the Data Science Scene?
    5. How can aspiring data professionals get started and what’s the best way to start?
    6. What are some of the most popular tools used in the data science industry and why?
    7. What is the UK Government doing to help?
    
    
> It is also worth highlighting that **Data Science Professionals** cover various job titles and responsibilities, and this analysis covers Data Science Professionals broadly. This includes those that are involved with different aspects of the **Data Analytics Lifecycle**, including Data Analysts, Data Managers, Data Scientists, Data Engineers, Data Professors, Data Administrators, Data Architects, Machine Learning Engineers etc.

## Concluding Remarks

This analysis focussed on a unique and specific subset of the dataset, i.e., UK Kagglers, represented in the 2022 Kaggle Machine Learning & Data Science Survey. Some interesting questions were posed around UK Data Professionals, which were answered with some data exploration, narrative texts and visualisations. These analyses and insights will benefit **aspiring data professionals, course developers and government organisations to help make more data-informed decisions**.  

A summary of the concluding remarks is shown below:

- Data Science Professionals in the UK have a **median salary of about £61,000**. However, this varies by job title, sector and years of experience. 


- The most **significant factors** in getting a higher salary in the UK are the **years of experience and job role**. For example, a Data Manager earns over six figures in the UK. Furthermore, whilst the line has become blurred between a Data Analyst and a Data Scientist, their salary certainly hasn’t. **Data Scientists earn about 24 - 44% more than Data Analysts in the UK**.


- It currently appears that the **Accounting/Finance, Computers/Technology and Online Service/Internet-based Services industries** tend to pay the highest salaries in the UK, however, more data is needed to validate this statement. 


- Most UK Data professionals find it more helpful and **prefer online courses (e.g. Coursera), Kaggle, and video platforms (e.g. YouTube) to get into Data Science**, and useful learning resources and recommended topics for **Microsft Excel, SQL, Power BI and Python** have been shared and discussed. 


- **Python** continues to be the most prevalent of all programming languages, with over **90% of Data Professionals using it regularly**. **SQL** is very popular with **Data Analysts and over 76% of them** use it regularly for extracting and analysing data from databases. 


- In terms of Python libraries, **Matplotlib and Seaborn** continue to be very popular with UK Data Professionals, as they have stood the test of time and have numerous in-built functions, loads of documentation and open-source codes that can be adapted. 


- In line with the adoption of cloud platforms, **Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Microsoft Azure** are the most used platforms for storing data by UK organisations. Learning these cloud computing platforms is important, especially if you're looking to go into Data Engineering and Machine Learning roles. In addition, course developers should look into embedding an introductory course focussed on a cloud computing platform (e.g. Introduction to AWS for Data Professionals), which can include an overview of the platform and details on how Data Professionals can access information, extract data or set up a database on these platforms. 


- UK **pays its Data Professionals more than its European counterparts** and shares the Top position with Germany.


- Different initiatives from the UK government to foster the growth of data science have been discussed. The successful implementation of these policies will have a **potential £13 billion boost to the UK economy yearly**.
